				Within the UK we work on the basis of the team using good judgment on what is a reasonable expense for business purposes and seeking to minimize all expense costs where possible.
				As we continue with this approach please remember to key points: 
				All expenses must be claimed within 30 days of the expense date. 
				This timeframe for obtaining reimbursement is so we can ensure expenses are claimed on a regular basis. 
				All new expenses must be approved prior to purchase. When you submit your monthly claim please attach related approval ernails. 
				Expense claims without an approval record won't be reimbursed.
				For full guidance please read the Travel & Expenses Policy 8, Procedure available on our intranet.
